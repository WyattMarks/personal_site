## [Paddle Ball Extreme](https://gears.prose.sh/paddleball)
###### 05/02/14

This here’s a mobile device game. It was made in Unity!

The objective is to keep the ball falling below your paddle. It’s a very simple game. It’s only on android at the moment, because I don’t want to pay the $25 to become a Google Developer. The game has a very retro feel, with simple colors. It’s very fun to just play and try to beat your previous record.

I had a lot of fun making this. Unity was such a change from the old nothing but code. Unity has its pros, but it also has it’s cons. I couldn’t find an easy way to make a gui/menu. What I ended up doing was just making 2D Planes with text painted on them, in the 3D environment. Good luck!
