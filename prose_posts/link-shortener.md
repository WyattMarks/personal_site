## [Link Shortener](https://gears.prose.sh/linkshortener)
###### 07/19/14




My site now has a link shortener! It’s pretty simple. It just stores the links ID in a MySQL database and uses PHP to refer that link’s id to the link.


~~[Here’s the link!](<!this_page!>)~~ (Removed after site migration. Also not as cool in 2022, lol.) (Now also not working on prose! I should abandon the old broken posts, but I refuse.)
