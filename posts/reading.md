## [Reading :book:](<!this_page!>) {post}
###### 07/03/23 {date} 


I like to read. Well, as an adult, I "read" more audio than text.


### What is "reading"?


By read I mean consume stories, originally written in novel form. 
There is plenty of text that I read throughout my day, but most
of it is written for articles or messages, not to tell a (long)
story. Regardless, it is my opinion that audio books are just as 
valid as paper books. It is also my opinion that digital books are 
also just as valid. I do not understand the hate that e-readers or 
audio book listeners get. It just seems so `holier-than-thou` that 
it's almost satirical. 


I say this, as I write in neovim. But I don't spurn people who use
other text editors or IDEs. Or at least I don't spurn them outside 
my own thoughts, lol. 


### What do *I* read?


Nowadays I mostly read Sci-Fi, but I've also been reading some fantasy.
There are a ton of good books, and here is (most of) my past couple of years in books:

- The Bobiverse (Dennis E. Taylor)
- The Mars Trilogy (Kim Stanley Robinson)
- Red Moon (KSR)
- 2312 (KSR)
- Icehenge (KSR)
- The Martian (Andy Weir)
- Project Hail Mary (Andy Weir)
- Children of Time (and sequels) (Adrian Tchaikovsky)
- The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (and sequels) (Stieg Larsson)
- Dune (the first 3) (Frank Herbert)
- The Hyperion Cantos (Dan Simmons)


Fantasy:

- American Gods (Neil Gaiman)
- The Years of Rice and Salt (KSR)
- The Ministry for the Future (KSR)
- The Stormlight Archive (Brandon Sanderson)

Non-Fiction:

- The High Sierra (KSR)


### Why should people read?


Reading is fun. It's a way to explore an alternate universe, and to 
challenge your mind. When I was young, I read all kinds of books. Plain
old fiction was my go-to choice, any and all of them. I remember reading
*Milkweed* by Jerry Spinelli and being absolutely floored. It was my 
first foray into the history of WWII, and it was visceral. I felt like 
I knew what it was like to grow up as a street urchin in Warsaw when 
in reality I was an average American boy. 


Not only is reading an exploration, but it really allows a young mind 
to understand how others think and feel. This is something I feel a 
lot of adults don't think about, either. An example of how the 
average person doesn't think about others actual lives is The 
Fundamental Attribution problem. 


 > As an example of the behavior which attribution error theory seeks to explain, consider the situation where Alice, a driver, is cut off in traffic by Bob. Alice attributes Bob's behavior to his fundamental personality; `e.g., He thinks only of himself, he is selfish, he is an unskilled driver.` She does not think it is situational; `e.g., He is going to miss his flight, his wife is giving birth at the hospital, his daughter is convulsing at school.`  


This is something that everyone struggles with, but I think reading helps a person see from others' perspectives. 


### Why do *I* read?


I read for the reasons given above. Exploring the universes created in 
books is not "an escape." I strongly dislike that phrase. People 
should not hide in their books. Rather, they should seek ways to change 
their surroundings with things they learn in books. That seems rather 
idealistic, though. Of course people will hide in their books. Imagine 
the young children of whichever war-torn land reading Harry Potter. 
They're certainly reading because they want an escape from the horror 
of their everyday. I should just say that I, personally, do not read 
to escape. I read to explore. To imagine worlds where something 
that is impossible today could happen. Or just where something plain 
old impossible could happen.


And then, on top of the reading, I love theorizing on my own time what 
could happen next. Sanderson's Cosmere books are a great examplef for this. 
The Cosmere has Laws, similar to our universe's laws, but with magic. 
The more I learn about the Cosmere, the more excited I become about the 
series based in it, since I understand what X thing meant, or what it 
means that Y has Z. And it's even more rewarding when I turn out to be 
correct. This exploration into what could be is what I love most about 
reading, or at least lately it has been. Sanderson's works are excellent
for this.


I also like to read to explore potential societal constructs that are 
incongruous with the life I've experienced in the capitalist era. 
KSR's books are so, so, so excellent in this regard. His original 
*Mars Trilogy* posits an evolution of the current feudal-capitalist 
system, one which codifies equality and the value of the worker. 
Then, his later works, like *2312*, explore similar ideas and how 
Earth could be moved to them. KSR gets more and more direct with 
his novels, with his most recent fiction novel, *The Ministry for 
Future*, only being set in the very near future instead of centuries 
away. After reading so many of KSR's books, and loving them all, 
I had to read his love letter to the Sierra Mountains. And that 
non-fiction book was amazing. It's now on my TODO list to visit 
the Sierras, and to go backpacking on my own newly defined trail.


### Social Aspects of Reading

There was a period of time, mostly high school, where I didn't do 
much reading at all. I told myself I was too busy, but that wasn't 
true. I don't know what caused it specifically, but it had certainly 
happened. And I didn't pick it back up for until after fall of 
sophomore year of university. My Diff. Eq. instructor and I somehow 
got on the topics of books. He highly recommended The Expanse series, 
and I told him I would check it out. He then kept asking how I liked it, 
so I was forced to read it. After reading the first book I flew through 
the rest of the novels that were out at the time.


And it was a lot different than it was when I was young. When I was young, 
not many of my peers would read the same books as me, and that was fine. 
I would read my books, maybe take an Accelerated Reader test on it, and 
then move on. I wouldn't discuss the things I had read very often, if at all. 


Now, though, I was talking all about the story with someone. They had their
own theories and ideas and it was *so exciting!* Every since then I've made 
an effort to find someone else who is interested in the things I'm reading, 
solely so I can discuss it with them. It's so fun to share thoughts 
and ideas about the text. This continued til today, where I discuss all of 
the books I'm reading with my coworkers who are also interested in the 
topics and genres I am.


I've never used the internet for sharing my thoughts on books, beyond the 
occasional comment on Reddit if a series was mentioned. With the migration
off Reddit, however, I have been tempted to check out something like 
GoodReads. GoodReads, though, is owned by Amazon and seems to have been 
mostly abandoned by them. After leaving Reddit, and joining a Lemmy instance,
though, I was checking out things on the Fediverse. I found [BookWyrm](http://joinbookwyrm.com/)
and it seems to be a promising alternative. I've registered, and started 
filling in some of my profile. I hope it continues to grow! It feels odd 
using a social media (honestly at all, I've never been someone who posts 
statuses to FaceBook or tweets to Twittr or anything, really) but I'll 
try to keep updates coming. Kinda like these posts, actually.
